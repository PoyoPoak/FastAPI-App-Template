# REAL EXAMPLES from this FastAPI stack:
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# users route: add email verification status to profile response
#
# Problem: Frontend needed to show whether a user verified their email,
# but the GET /api/v1/users/me endpoint wasn't returning that field.
#
# Changed: Modified backend/app/api/routes/users.py to include
# email_verified boolean in UserPublic schema response.
#
# Tested: Hit the endpoint via curl after logging in, confirmed
# email_verified appears. Frontend dashboard now displays the badge.
#
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# login page: implement password visibility toggle
#
# Problem: Users couldn't see what they typed when entering passwords
# on the login form, leading to frequent typos.
#
# Changed: Added eye icon button to frontend/src/routes/login.tsx
# that toggles password input between type="password" and type="text".
# Used lucide-react Eye and EyeOff icons.
#
# Tested: Manually tested clicking toggle on /login page, verified
# password becomes visible/hidden correctly.
#
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# docker services: increase PostgreSQL shared_buffers for performance
#
# Problem: Database queries were slow with the default 128MB buffer.
# App now has 100k+ rows and needs more memory for caching.
#
# Changed: Modified compose.yml to set PostgreSQL shared_buffers
# to 512MB via command args. Also bumped container memory limit.
#
# Tested: Rebuilt stack with docker compose down && docker compose up,
# ran pgbench to confirm 3x faster SELECT performance. Alembic
# migrations still work fine.
#
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# alembic: add full-text search indexes to items table
#
# Problem: Searching items by title was doing slow sequential scans
# on 50k+ rows. Queries took 5+ seconds.
#
# Changed: Created alembic migration 2024_02_06_add_item_search_idx
# that adds GIN index on title column for fast ILIKE queries.
#
# Tested: Ran migration on local DB via docker compose exec backend
# alembic upgrade head. Checked in Adminer that index exists. Search
# queries now return in <100ms.
